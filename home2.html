			<h2><u>Introduction To Animals:</u></h2>
		<br>
		
			<p align="left"><b>The word animal comes from the Latin animalis, meaning 'having breath', 'having soul' or 'living being'.The biological definition includes all members of the kingdom Animalia.In colloquial usage, the term animal is often used to refer only to nonhuman animals.</p>
			<br>
			<p align="left">Animals (also called Metazoa) are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and go through an ontogenetic stage in which their body consists of a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres (110 ft). They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology.</p>
			<br>
			<p align="left">Humans make use of many animal species, such as for food (including meat, milk, and eggs), for materials (such as leather and wool), as pets, and as working animals including for transport. Dogs have been used in hunting, as have birds of prey, while many terrestrial and aquatic animals were hunted for sports. Nonhuman animals have appeared in art from the earliest times and are featured in mythology and religion.</p>
			<br>
			<h2><u>Ecology:</u></h2>
		<br>
			<p align="left">Most animals rely on the biomass and energy produced by plants through photosynthesis.Herbivores eat plant material directly, while carnivores, and other animals on higher trophic levels typically acquire it indirectly by eating other animals. Animals oxidize carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and other biomolecules to unlock the chemical energy of molecular oxygen,which allows the animal to grow and to sustain biological processes such as locomotion.Animals living close to hydrothermal vents and cold seeps on the dark sea floor consume organic matter of archaea and bacteria produced in these locations through chemosynthesis (by oxidizing inorganic compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide).</p>
		<br>	
			<h2><u>Evolutionary origin:</u></h2>
			<p align="left">The first fossils that might represent animals appear in the 665-million-year-old rocks of the Trezona Formation of South Australia. These fossils are interpreted as most probably being early sponges.</p>
			<p align="left">Animals are found as long ago as the Ediacaran biota, towards the end of the Precambrian, and possibly somewhat earlier. It had long been doubted whether these life-forms included animals,but the discovery of the animal lipid cholesterol in fossils of Dickinsonia establishes their nature.Animals are thought to have originated under low-oxygen conditions, suggesting that they were capable of living entirely by anaerobic respiration, but as they became specialized for aerobic metabolism they became fully dependent on oxygen in their environments.</p>

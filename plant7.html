			<p align="left">Ipomopsis sancti-spiritus is a rare species of flowering plant in the phlox family known by the common name Holy Ghost ipomopsis. It is endemic to New Mexico in the United States, where it is known from only one canyon in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. It is a federally listed endangered species.<b></p>
			<br>
			<p align="left">This plant was first described in 1988, when specimens were found to differ slightly from the description of the very similar Ipomopsis aggregata.The species is known only from a two-mile (3-km) stretch of Holy Ghost Canyon in San Miguel County, northern New Mexico.[2][3] Though estimates of the population are difficult to make because of the plant's similarity to I. aggregata,some estimates have ranged from 372 to 2047 individuals.Research suggests the plant is at high risk for extinction.</p>
			<br>
			<p align="left">This species has low fecundity, rarely reproducing successfully, with fewer than 10% of flowers producing fruits and the fruits containing few viable seeds.With relatively few individuals in the breeding pool it likely suffers from inbreeding depression.Forecasts indicate that the plant is likely to reach extinction within 50 years.</p>
